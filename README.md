# BabyMobsAddon
 This add-on adds the baby form of many mobs, such as baby creepers, baby skeletons, baby endermen, and more. While similar add-ons already exist, they are either outdated or no longer available. In this add-on, you can find them in the world, or spawn them with spawn eggs or commands.
